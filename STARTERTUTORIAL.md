## How to Git

Here, I'll link you to a couple of documents. This document itself is a tutorial that points you to other tutorials, but specific ones so you don't waste your time reading through a bunch of unnecessary stuff!  

- Setting up and knowing how to use Git
 - The easiest way to get your environment set up is to download GitHub Desktop, you should go [here](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started/) for the tutorials. 
 - You should just look into the Setting up GitHub Desktop bullet, where you'll learn to install, authenticate, and configure git. 
 - Check this [page](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) out to learn git the easy way. 

- How to use AngularJS
 - [Here](http://www.w3schools.com/angular/) is a good tutorial on AngularJS.
 - Most notaby, you should check out the HOME, Intro, Expressions, Modules, Directives, Model, Controllers, Scopes, Filters, DOM, Angular Application. 
 - Each section is pretty short to go over!
